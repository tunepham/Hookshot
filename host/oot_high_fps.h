/* (hookshot) Two places in the game that need whole 60 fps frames, under a Frame rate cap above 60, where the frame step is the
   frame's own time (host/nn_vi.c, hos_frame_seconds_bits: 0.5 at 120 fps). nx2/oot_patches.py hooks them; host/oot_high_fps.c
   holds the state. At a cap of 60 (no frame time given: timed 0) both return what the game computed, so nothing changes.

   The sound manager's job (f_80435300, its phase in w2): phase 0 hands the game step to the sound engine, whose fade and delay
   timers and parameter ramps count updates of at least one whole step. Fed less, some sounds are not released when an area
   unloads, the voices in use climb until the game's voice budget is full, and new sounds (sword, voices), then the area music,
   stop until a restart. Above 60 fps the job runs at 60 Hz: phase 0 adds the step to a remainder and runs once a whole step has
   built up, with a step of 1 (sound_step), keeping the rest; the job's other phases follow that frame's choice. Sound keeps the
   clock on average. A step of 1 or more runs as the game has it and keeps the remainder: around 60 fps (a cap above 60 with
   the game near 60, or VRR) steps of 0.98 and 1.02 alternate, and the 0.98 that did not run comes back as a whole step later
   (dropped, the sound clock ran at half the real one). A step of 0 or less (or NaN), and every phase at a cap of 60, run as the
   game has them, and clear the remainder.
   (After zortos293/Lichii PR #1289 by auz466, GPL-3.0: the same gate as a code patch for the emulator.)

   The physics world's solver steps: the game sets them each update to (int)(frame step * the steps of a 60 fps frame + 0.001)
   (f_838ceb80 and f_838cfc10, into the solver's +712; 8 a 60 fps frame in the places seen). A step under 1 cuts that short,
   and as the measured step wanders around its mean the count changes from frame to frame (8 x 0.49 is 3, 8 x 0.5 is 4 at 120
   fps); 4 steps a 60 fps frame would be 0 above 240. A moving platform (the stone one under the spikes in the Deku Tree)
   then slides out from under Link (issue 1798). While the step is under 1 the count is rounded up instead, so a solver step
   never covers more time than at 60 fps, give or take 10% (the frame time's jitter, so a steady rate keeps a steady count),
   and it is at least 1 and never under the game's. A step of 1 or more (a frame slower than 60 fps) keeps the game's count. */
